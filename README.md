This is a simple reuseable card with some the option of changing the background color of the dom on button click. It applies the same logic with the text highlighter previously built.

# How To Set It Up On Your Local Machine
Clone this git repo: git clone (https://github.com/trizzi/React-Cards.git)

Get in the directory of the project

open in an editing tool(Vscode recommended)

use the following command in your CLI to run your code: 
* npm init
* npm start


After that there will be a link in display after it starts running which is http://localhost:3000/ (This link will work if the project is properly setup in your computer and run at the default react port)

# Libraries And Frameworks Used For The Project
* React and chakra-ui for frontend
